# Thread-Art-Portrait-Enhanced-by-SVD

1. Darkest line among all the lines from one hook to all other hooks around a gray scale image's circumference is selected in each iteration.

2. Selected line is removed and the numbers of the hooks forming that line are appended to the output matrix.

3. Svd and fft are used to overlay the edge detected image on the de noised image to result in efficient output.

4. Thread art portrait of the user inputted image is obtained when all the hooks are connected in the order specified by the output matrix
